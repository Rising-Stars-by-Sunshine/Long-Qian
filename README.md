# Hi guys, I'm Long Qian 
A computer science student interested in the combination of the two fields

## About Me
  I'm a DKU undergraduate student in the class of 2026 majoring in Apllied Math and Computer Science. For my CS experience, I was learning informatics contest when I was in junior high school and I've taken most CS courses required in my track. Besides, I'm researching on topics of reinforcement learning with Professor Luo. About my ECON experience, I have only taken ECON101. However, I'm quite interested in the combination of computer science and economy fields, especially in quantitative finance.  
  
  Looking forward to having an excellent journey with you guys!
